class RedisTicketStream(RedisComponent):
    """
    Listens for ticket creation/change/deletion events and and publishes
    them to the relevant channels:

        * Ticket creation events are published to the
          ``<prefix>.<env>.ticket.created`` channel, where ``<prefix>`` is the
          configurable channel name prefix (e.g. 'trac'), and ``<env>`` is the
          environment name.

          Messages on this channel consist of the field values of the created
          ticket (along with the ticket ID) as a JSON-encoded dictionary::

              {
                  "id": 1,
                  "summary": "...",
                  "description": "...",
                  ...
              }

        * Ticket change events are published to the
          ``<prefix>.<env>.ticket.changed.<id>`` channel, where ``<prefix>``
          and ``<env>`` are as before, and ``<id>`` is the ticket ID.  This
          allows subscribing just to the changes on a specific ticket, if
          desired.  The message is a JSON-encoded dictionary with the following
          format::

              {
                  "id": 1,
                  "new_values": { ... },
                  "old_values": { ... },
                  "author": "somebody",
                  "comment": "A comment..."
              }

          Where ``"id"`` is the ticket ID. ``"new_values"`` maps field names to
          their new values (including fields that did not change), and
          ``"old_values"`` maps field names to the previous values of fields
          that changed.  ``"author"`` is the author of the change, and
          ``"comment"`` is the comment associated with the change (which may be
          blank).

        * Ticket deletion events are published to the
          ``<prefix>.<env>.ticket.deleted`` channel.  These events have the
          same format as ticket creation events, and include the values of all
          the fields on the just-deleted ticket.
